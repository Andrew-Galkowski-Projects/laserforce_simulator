The ``league_screens/*`` HTML views and the ``/api/leagues/<id>/...`` screen
actions call the same functions here, so the two never drift apart. Nothing in
this module reads a request: callers pass the League, the resolved Season
scope and the screen's already-validated params.

import this module). ``league_views`` re-exports the moved private names under
their old spellings; tests patch ``matches.league_screen_services.*``.
