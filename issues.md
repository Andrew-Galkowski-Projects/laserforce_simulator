# Web testing — CONF-01 (Conference foundation)

Date: 2026-06-29
Branch: `conf-01-conference-foundation`
Scope: the league surfaces CONF-01 touched — the Season **Standings** page
(`season_standings` view + `templates/seasons/standings.html`, rewritten to render
one table per Conference) and the season/league **dashboards**
(`_build_dashboard_context` top-3 snippet). CONF-01 is admin-only (Conferences are
created via Django Admin; no create-League composer yet) and a **zero-Conference
Season is byte-identical to before**, so the browser smoke targets the
zero-Conference regression path on real data (completed league 42 / season 58).

## Summary — CONF-01
| Area | Result |
|---|---|
| League dashboard (`/leagues/42/`) renders — top-3 standings snippet, leaders, next-round, View-bracket, nav | ✅ |
| Season Standings (`/seasons/58/standings/`) zero-Conference renders the single `season-standings-table` byte-identically — full 17-column LG-06g table, all sortable headers, Champion line | ✅ |
| Console clean (no messages) on `/leagues/`, dashboard, and standings | ✅ |
| Network all 2xx (page doc + Bootstrap CDN) on every surface walked | ✅ |

## Findings — CONF-01
- **No bugs found.** The zero-Conference regression path is clean end-to-end: the
  rewritten `season_standings` view + per-group template render the existing single
  table identically (no `season-standings-conference-*` ids emitted when there are
  no Conferences), and the dashboard snippet is unchanged. Zero console errors, zero
  non-2xx requests.
- `/seasons/60/standings/` 404'd — a stale/deleted season id from a prior member-night
  test run, **not** a CONF-01 regression (the route resolves fine for valid seasons,
  e.g. season 58).
- **Multi-Conference rendering not exercised in-browser:** a populated per-Conference
  standings page needs Conferences set on a *draft* Season then played (the play loop
  stamps `Match.conference`); retrofitting Conferences onto an already-completed Season
  via admin would render unrepresentative empty/zero-filled tables. That rendering path
  (stacked per-Conference tables + the `season-standings-conference-{id}` /
  `-conference-name-{id}` DOM ids) is covered by the passing `test_season_views.py`
  view tests, which render the real template through the Django test client with
  Conferences present. No browser-only gap remains for the foundation slice.
